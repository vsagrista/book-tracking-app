## Welcome to Book Tracking App

This is an application created to grasp some of the core concepts of react, such as props, state and routing. I will update new functionalities periodically. It has been built using the create-react-app tool.<br>
The basic structure has been provided by Udacity's team. I will add functionality to it as part of my react training.

# Book Tracking App

Welcome to Book Tracking App! This is an application created to grasp some of the core concepts of react, such as props, state and routing, as part of the "React Nanodegree from Udacity". It is built using the create-react-app toolset.<br>
It consists in a book library in which users can add books to their collections, including the option of sorting them by shelf (e.g. "Books currently reading"). The books are updated using React's state and in the API.<br>
The users can also search new books in the API and add them to any of their collections. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.
