## Welcome to Book Tracking App

This is an application created to grasp some of the core concepts of react, such as props, state and routing. I will update new functionalities periodically. It has been built using the create-react-app tool.<br>
The basic structure has been provided by Udacity's team. I will add functionality to it as part of my react training.
